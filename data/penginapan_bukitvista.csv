Located on the slope of Bingin, next to Kelly’s Warung and the main area of Bingin beach. You can bring your pet along with you! The facilities in this beach house are: ☑ 4 bedrooms with air conditioner ☑ Fan in the living room ☑ Full kitchen ☑ TV with Netflix service ☑ Ocean view from the living room The space A villa on a coastal cliff with a bohemian-themed interior, this villa will make your stay more memorable and photogenic. We will provide useful information for you before you decide to book this property and become a resident of Bingin Beach who has to climb hundreds of steps down. This villa is the perfect pit stop for surfers. Just by looking out of the window, you surfers can see if the wave is good or not, before deciding to get down and ride the wave. ✦ IMPORTANT NOTES ✦ Since this villa is located on a coastal cliff with hundreds of steps, we advise you not to check-in at night because it will be easier to get lost and difficult to see the direction. Make sure your suitcase or luggage is light, or ask the porter to carry it down and pay for the effort they have expended (as agreed with them). This is Bali, monkeys running around is a natural thing! Likewise in Bingin, maybe the monkeys will visit your villa. Make sure your valuables are stored neatly. There’s not much in the kitchen. So it will be better to bring your own food or groceries and cook it in the kitchen. ✦ AVAILABILITY ✦ This listing availability is always updated. We are also available for long-term rent, weekly or monthly! For weekly and monthly bookings, the rate does not include utility costs ✦ THE VILLA ✦ This is a whole villa where you can enjoy your holiday with your family or friends. You have access to all 4 bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms. Breeze living room with a fan and dining area are spacious. We also have a big fully equipped kitchen where you can cook your favorite food. But please note we do not provide condiments. There is a refrigerator and also a water dispenser which only has fresh and hot water, not cold water. ✦ A LITTLE SEA VIEW & ACCESS ✦ The villa has a slightly direct view of Bingin Sea. Just a slight because there’s another villa right in front of this one so the view is kinda blocked (annoying I know). But why do you need the view if you can feel it with your whole body? You can access the beach just by going downstairs a little bit! ✦ EXTRA BED ✦ We don’t have an extra bed on this property. ✦ ONLINE HOST ✦ Our online hosts are going to be ready to assist you from 9 AM-6 PM (GMT +8). We will do our best to respond to your messages as quickly as possible. However please tolerate a small delay in the response if you contact us outside of the above-mentioned hours. ✦ CONSTRUCTION ✦ For your information, you may encounter some constructions around the villa, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Please expect some construction noise during the day (the default working hour is 8 AM-5 PM). This property is located in the midst of a growing area. Which means easy access to food and beach, but it also means many property owners in the area are building and renovating their properties. We encourage you to go explore and enjoy the beach during the day instead or please kindly bring some earplugs with you. ✦ WIFI ✦ You’re probably not going to like this, but we will be as honest as possible about WiFi. We don’t have 100% reliable WiFi in Bali especially during the rainy season, even though we have installed from the best company. The WiFi speed is as you can see in the picture, but we would say that the WiFi works around 40% – 80% only at the moment.

A wise man said, “Expect nothing during travel, and then you will find a meaningful experience.” Guest access The entire villa is yours. You can park a car at the top of Bingin beach, there’s a large parking area. There is no pool here, but no worries because Bingin Beach is less than 5 minutes away on foot! ✦ ABOUT BINGIN ✦ Bingin is heaven for surfers. If you’re a surfer and looking for a perfect wave, then this is the place. The sea is your playground and natural swimming pool, just be careful because there are lots of coral/rocks on its coast. Imagine being just steps away from heaven, you don’t have to worry about transportation anymore. An adventurous spot, just a few meters away from Bali’s waves. You’ll get to see wild monkeys nearby, it will be a full Balinese experience! ✦ VILLA ACCESS ✦ From the parking to the villa is a downstairs walk of about 400 meters. And it’s a pretty steep stair. ✦ ADDITIONAL NOTES ✦ The onsite team will assist you, starting from 9 am – 5 pm and also we will assist you through instant messaging to answer the information that you need =) And we don’t recommend the elderly to come to this villa because of its steep stairs. You’ll be right on the waves but not far from food or company. Kelly’s Warung is right next door and opens from morning to evening. It’s one of the best places to eat on the beach. In addition, there are almost half-a-dozen other great places to eat, drink, and rent surf gear along this beach. There is 2 store upstairs, and you can find a bar in the Padang Padang area, about 10 minutes drive from this villa as well. ✦ NEARBY LOCATION ✦ Walk downstairs to Bingin Beach Walk to your side to Kelly’s Warung 2 min drive to The Cashew Tree 4 min drive to Bali Fit Corner 5 min drive to Gooseberry Restaurant Other things to note PET You can bring your cute pet to our place 🙂 BREAKFAST We don’t provide breakfast.
